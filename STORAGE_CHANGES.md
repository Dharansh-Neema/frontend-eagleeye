# Storage System Changes

## Overview
The image storage system has been updated to automatically handle file storage without requiring users to manually select a storage location during project setup.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Storage Location Selection from Project Setup
- **File**: `src/components/classify/ProjectSetup.tsx`
- **Changes**: 
  - Removed `storagePath` field from form state
  - Removed `handleStorageSelect` function
  - Removed storage location input UI
  - Updated form validation to not require storage path
  - Updated description to inform users about automatic storage handling

### 2. Created File Service for Automatic Storage
- **File**: `src/lib/fileService.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Automatic directory structure creation: `Organization/Project/InspectionStation/`
  - Subdirectories: `images/` and `metadata/`
  - Unique image ID generation (img-001, img-002, etc.)
  - JSON metadata files with standardized structure
  - Support for File System Access API (modern browsers)
  - Fallback to download-based storage for unsupported browsers

### 3. Added TypeScript Definitions
- **File**: `src/types/fileSystem.d.ts`
- **Purpose**: Type definitions for File System Access API
- **Updated**: `tsconfig.app.json` to include types directory

### 4. Updated Image Categorization Component
- **File**: `src/components/classify/ImageCategorization.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Integrated with new file service
  - Added loading states during save operation
  - Improved error handling with user-friendly messages
  - Automatic directory selection prompt when saving

## How It Works

### For Modern Browsers (Chrome, Edge)
1. User completes project setup (no storage selection required)
2. User uploads and categorizes images
3. When clicking "Save & Finish", user is prompted to select a directory
4. Images and metadata are automatically organized in the selected directory

### For Other Browsers
1. Same process as above
2. When saving, metadata files are downloaded as JSON files
3. User needs to manually organize images according to the metadata structure

## Directory Structure Created
```
[Selected Directory]/
├── [Organization Name]/
│   ├── [Project Name]/
│   │   ├── [Inspection Station]/
│   │   │   ├── images/
│   │   │   │   ├── img-001.jpg
│   │   │   │   ├── img-002.png
│   │   │   │   └── ...
│   │   │   └── metadata/
│   │   │       ├── img-001.json
│   │   │       ├── img-002.json
│   │   │       └── ...
```

## Benefits
- **Simplified User Experience**: No need to select storage location upfront
- **Consistent Organization**: Automatic directory structure creation
- **Cross-Browser Support**: Fallback options for different environments
- **Data Integrity**: Structured metadata with unique IDs
- **Future-Proof**: Easy to extend for additional storage backends

## Technical Notes
- Uses File System Access API when available
- Graceful degradation for unsupported browsers
- Sanitizes filenames to prevent filesystem issues
- Generates ISO 8601 timestamps for metadata
- Maintains original file extensions for images
