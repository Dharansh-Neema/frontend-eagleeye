**EagleEye V2 Frontend MVP - Product Requirements Document**

**Product Overview**

EagleEye V2 is a web-based platform for machine vision system integrators to build accurate inspection solutions through efficient image annotation, ground truth management, and dataset creation for training and evaluation.

**Target Users**

* Primary: Machine vision system integrators building quality control solutions
* Secondary: Quality control engineers and vision system operators

**Core User Value Proposition**

Streamlined workflow for collecting, annotating, and managing training datasets with optimized UI for rapid image grading and ground truth annotation.

**MVP Scope & Key Features**

**1. Authentication & Project Access**

* Login/Registration: Simple email/password authentication
* Project Switching: Quick project selector for users with multi-project access
* Role-based UI: Same interface with conditional edit permissions (Admin vs User)

**2. Image Upload & Management Hub**

* Training Data Upload: Bulk upload for raw images without ground truth
* Multi-file drag-and-drop interface
* Progress tracking for large batches
* Associate images with specific camera/inspection station
* Production Inference Upload: Batch upload for model output evaluation
* Automatic EXIF metadata extraction for inference results
* Parse and populate observation values from image metadata
* Visual confirmation of extracted inference data
* Image Gallery: Grid view with thumbnails, pagination, and basic filtering
* Image Details: Full-size image viewer with metadata display

**3. Ground Truth Annotation System Core Feature**

* **Image-level Annotation Interface:**
    * Side-by-side layout: Image viewer + annotation form
    * Dynamic form fields based on project's observation types
    * Support for text, number, and categorical data types
    * Quick navigation between images (Previous/Next buttons)
* Annotation Status Tracking: Visual indicators for annotated vs unannotated images
* Batch Operations: Select multiple images for status updates

**4. Dataset Creation & Management**

* Query Builder: Simple interface to filter images by ground truth values
* Dataset Assembly: Create training/evaluation datasets from filtered results
* Dataset Export: Download capabilities for external use

**7. Project Structure Navigation**

* Upload Type Selection: Choose between training data vs production inference upload
* Batch Upload Interface:
    * Camera/station selection before upload
    * Progress tracking with error handling
    * EXIF metadata preview for inference uploads
    * Upload History: Track and manage previous upload sessions
* Hierarchical View: Organization Project Inspection Station Camera structure
* Context Switching: Maintain user's current location while allowing easy navigation
* Breadcrumb Navigation: Clear path showing current location

**User Workflows**

**Primary Workflow: Training Data Collection & Annotation**

1.  User uploads batch of raw images (no ground truth)
2.  Selects project/camera context for upload
3.  Opens annotation interface
4.  Views image and manually adds ground truth observations
5.  Quickly moves to next unannotated image

**--- PAGE 3 ---**

6.  Repeats until batch is complete

**Secondary Workflow: Production Evaluation**

1.  User uploads images with inference results in EXIF metadata
2.  System extracts and displays inference observations
3.  User reviews and adds/corrects ground truth for comparison
4.  Creates evaluation datasets from annotated production data

**Tertiary Workflow: Dataset Creation**

1.  User defines filter criteria based on ground truth values
2.  Reviews filtered image set
3.  Creates and names dataset
4.  Exports for training/evaluation use

**Technical Requirements**

**Performance Priorities**

* Fast Image Loading: Optimized image display and caching
* Responsive Annotation: Minimal latency between image switches
* Efficient EXIF Processing: Quick metadata extraction and parsing
* Efficient Pagination: Handle large image collections smoothly

**UI/UX Principles**

* Clean Minimalist Design: Uncluttered interface focusing on core functionality
* Blue & White Color Scheme: Primary blue (`#3882F6`) with white backgrounds and subtle gray accents
* shadcn/ui Component Library: Consistent, accessible components throughout
* Keyboard Shortcuts: Support for rapid annotation workflows
* Progressive Loading: Show content as it becomes available
* Clear Visual Hierarchy: Prioritize annotation interface clarity
* Mobile-Friendly: Responsive design for tablet/mobile access

**Design System**

* Primary Color: Blue `#3882F6` for primary actions, navigation, and key elements

**--- PAGE 4 ---**

* Secondary Color: White (`#FFFFFF`) for backgrounds and content areas
* Accent Colors: Light gray (`#F8FAFC`) for subtle backgrounds, dark gray (`#647488`) for text
* Typography: Clean, readable fonts with clear hierarchy
